# Wildlife Monitoring (Detection)

This is the repository for the final project of my Master's Degree course in Vision for Industry and Environment.
It is centered around an image detection task, specifically focused on wildlife monitoring.

The dataset a subset of [the MOF dataset](https://data.uni-marburg.de/entities/dataset/eafc2547-4616-48a4-b9ee-cd28f207afba) (licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)), which consists of a total of ~2500 camera trap images, recorded in the Marburg Open Forest in Hesse, Germany [^1]
([Schneider et al., 2023](https://inf-cv.uni-jena.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Talk-8-Daniel-Schneider.pdf)).

In particular, I worked on a 300 images subset of the MOF dataset, and applied manual labelling with the [YoloLabel](https://github.com/developer0hye/Yolo_Label?tab=readme-ov-file) tool on this subset.
